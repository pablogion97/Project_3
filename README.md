# Project_3
Generate a 4 sided structured grid (2D) using interpolation methods. Project 3 SF2568 Program construction in C++ for Scientific Computing. KTH Stockholm

The program is set to compute a 2D domain given 4 boundary curves. A user can create subclasses of the Curvebase class to implement own custom boundary curves.
